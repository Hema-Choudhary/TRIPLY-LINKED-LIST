# TRIPLY-LINKED-LIST
A Linked List with each node having three links
Triply linked list [tll], 
    where the first two links in each node point to next and previous nodes in the list
    and
    where the third link in every node, n, points to the 
    smallest element in the list that is larger than the element in the node n. if no such 
    element exists then the link should be set to NULL.

 your program should support the following operations on the tll
  - create a tll
  - insert entries in the created tll
  - delete entries from the given tll
  - sequential traversal of the elements using all the 3 links
